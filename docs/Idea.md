# Rumple My Dream

## Prompt

I have an idea for an AI application. This is for an art festival.

It's a private thing, one person. They go into a booth which lights their face. A camera shows a video of them. Its all real-time. I then begin to "decorate" the video, live and  in real-time.

Their face changes, tattoos, colors, eye color, hair, fantasy, sci fi, whatever. Might be driven by a prompt. The background can change as well.

On local hardware realtime will be a problem, but was thinking of sending the image frames to a cloud machine where I can rent powerful H200 processors. A crappy frame rate would be OK, 1 per second would be the minimum.

How might I go about designing this? I'm fluent in Python, which is probably the language I can use. I'd like to do this with open-source tools, possibly stable diffusion, but with API access rather than a frontend like automatic111.

Below is an updated design that incorporates real‑time speech recognition and prompt generation into your system, along with the image transformation pipeline. The revised workflow uses a local client to capture both video and audio, converts speech into text, transforms that text into a creative prompt, and then sends the frame plus prompt to a cloud‑based image transformation service.

## System Architecture

1. Updated System Architecture

Local Client (Booth Side):
 • Video Capture: Continues to use a camera (with OpenCV or similar) to capture video frames at the desired interval (e.g., 1 frame per second).
 • Audio Capture & Speech Recognition:
 • Capture audio continuously from a microphone.
 • Use an open‑source speech recognition engine (e.g., Vosk, DeepSpeech, or Python’s SpeechRecognition library with an offline backend) to transcribe the user’s speech in real time.
 • Prompt Generation:
 • Use a lightweight natural language processing module (for instance, a fine‑tuned transformer or a simple rules‑based system) to convert the raw transcription into a more elaborate prompt.
 • For example, if the user says “I want red hair,” your module might output “a young man sits placidly with red hair.”
 • Store this as the current prompt. If no new speech is detected, continue using the previous prompt.
 • Data Transmission:
 • Package the latest video frame and the current creative prompt together.
 • Send these over the network (using HTTP, WebSockets, or another protocol) to your cloud server.

Simplified Diagram:

           [Local Client: Audio Capture & Speech Recognition]

                           │  
                           └─> [Packaging Frame + Prompt] --HTTP--> [Cloud Server]

2. Client‑Side Implementation Details

Video & Audio Capture
 • Video Capture:
Use OpenCV to capture frames at your set interval.

```python
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
ret, frame = cap.read()  # Capture a frame

### Resize/encode frame as needed
```

 • Audio Capture & Speech Recognition:
Use a library such as Vosk to process audio input in real time.

```python
import vosk, sys, json
import pyaudio

model = vosk.Model("path_to_vosk_model")
recognizer = vosk.KaldiRecognizer(model, 16000)
mic = pyaudio.PyAudio()
stream = mic.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=16000, input=True, frames_per_buffer=8192)
stream.start_stream()

def get_transcription():
    data = stream.read(4096, exception_on_overflow=False)
    if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data):
        result = json.loads(recognizer.Result())
        return result.get("text", "")
    return ""
```

Prompt Generation
 • Processing the Transcription:
Write a simple function or integrate a small NLP model to translate the raw transcription into a more creative prompt.

def generate_prompt(transcription, default_prompt):
    if transcription.strip():
        # Example: a simple mapping or heuristic. For a more advanced solution,
        # consider integrating a pre-trained transformer model.
        # E.g., "I want red hair" -> "a young man sits placidly with red hair"
        # This could be as simple as inserting the color into a pre-defined template.
        return f"a person with {transcription} style"
    return default_prompt

### Initial default prompt, which might be updated as speech is recognized

current_prompt = "a portrait with creative lighting"

Data Packaging & Transmission
 • Combining Video & Prompt:
On each capture cycle, update the prompt from recent speech if available, then send the frame and prompt to your server.

```python
import requests
import cv2
from io import BytesIO

### Assume `frame` is obtained from OpenCV and `current_prompt` is updated

_, buffer = cv2.imencode('.jpg', frame)
image_bytes = buffer.tobytes()

response = requests.post("<https://your-cloud-server/api/process>",
                         files={"image": image_bytes},
                         data={"prompt": current_prompt})

### Process the response to display the transformed image

processed_image_data = response.content
```

### For example, using OpenCV to decode and display

nparr = np.frombuffer(processed_image_data, np.uint8)
processed_frame = cv2.imdecode(nparr, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
cv2.imshow("Transformed Frame", processed_frame)

 • Continuous Loop:
Run the video and audio capture in parallel (using threading or asynchronous programming) so that:
 • The video capture loop sends a frame (with the current prompt) every second.
 • The audio loop continuously updates the current_prompt based on new speech.

3. Server‑Side Implementation (Cloud)

Your server architecture remains largely the same as in the original design, with a few refinements:
 • API Endpoint:
Use FastAPI to handle incoming requests that now include both an image and a text prompt.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile, Form
from fastapi.responses import Response
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/api/process")
async def process_image(image: UploadFile = File(...), prompt: str = Form(...)):
    image_data = await image.read()
    input_image = Image.open(BytesIO(image_data)).convert("RGB")

    # Process image using the AI transformation pipeline
    output_image = run_ai_transformation(input_image, prompt)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    output_image.save(buf, format="JPEG")
    return Response(content=buf.getvalue(), media_type="image/jpeg")
```

 • Image-to-Image Transformation:
Continue to use a Stable Diffusion (or similar) image-to-image pipeline. The model now receives the dynamically updated prompt.

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline
import torch

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
pipe = StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "your-model-name",
    revision="fp16",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16
).to(device)

def run_ai_transformation(input_image, prompt):
    # Adjust strength and inference steps to balance speed and quality.
    result = pipe(prompt=prompt, image=input_image, strength=0.75, num_inference_steps=25)
    return result.images[0]
```

 • Deployment & Scalability:
Deploy this API on a GPU‑enabled cloud instance. Containerize your application with Docker for ease of deployment and scale based on usage.

4. Integration Considerations
 • Latency & Synchronization:
 • Ensure that the audio processing and video capture threads share the current prompt state correctly.
 • Consider using a queue or shared variable with thread‑safe mechanisms to update the prompt in real time.
 • Error Handling & Fallbacks:
 • If speech recognition fails or no speech is detected, simply reuse the last valid prompt.
 • In the event of network issues or high latency, display the last successfully transformed frame.
 • User Experience:
 • Keep the feedback loop engaging even if processing runs at a lower frame rate.
 • Optionally, display the current text prompt on screen so the user understands how their speech is being interpreted.

Final Overview

The enhanced design now features a dual‑input client that captures both video and audio, converting speech into creative transformation prompts on the fly. The client packages a video frame and the latest prompt and sends these to a cloud server, which applies an AI‑driven image transformation using a tool such as Stable Diffusion. This results in a continuously evolving display that reflects both the user’s visual presence and their spoken input in real time.

This modular design allows you to adjust each component—video capture, speech recognition, prompt generation, and image transformation—independently, ensuring that you can fine‑tune performance and user experience for the art festival environment.
